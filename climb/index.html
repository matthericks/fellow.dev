        Set up a toprope for a couple friends who do not climb outside very
        much. One had been on it prevously, and got a bit farther this time. I
        enjoy this route for warming up. It is not too physically challenging,
        but the bolts are a bit run out at the bottom, helping get me into a
        good mindset for the day.

        Thought we were setting up on the route just to the left of this, but
        decided to stick with this one even after we sorted out which climb we
        were on. Ended up with middling success on the bottom secion for a while
        before just going through the top half, which was very enjoyable. Have a
        better understanding of what I would want to do on it next time after
        sorting out what people are using for the start.

        Had hopped on a couple moves during my first time at Barn Bluff at least
        10 years back when I was just starting climbing. It felt impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Was on top rope for my first real attempt at it, and nearly flashed it.
        EVerything I had sorted out for beta felt great, and the holds that felt
        impossible before felt more like resting spots. The only move I didn't
        get on my first go I was able do after finishing the rest of the climb.
        It was pretty much what I had been doing, just trying a bit harder, and
        should go on my next attempt. In the moment it felt like pulling the
        move would have spent me for the rest of the climb, but after that
        single move the climb is more or less done and the rest is just a
        victory lap.
